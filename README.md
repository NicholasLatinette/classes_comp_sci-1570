## classes_comp_sci-1570
Here I was, a senior student, and I realized how big of a mistake it was to not have a github with my school assignments to look back on and to stack my github up!
Fast forward, and I notice a folder on my laptop that contains some of the homeworks from the first CS class I ever took. This is more for me to look back on more than anything else, as the code here is disguisting... it was my first time coding after all...
